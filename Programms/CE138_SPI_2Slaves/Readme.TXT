1. Code Example Description:
----------------------------
This code example shows using the SPI module in conjunction with 2 GPIO pins to communicate with 2 different slave
devices.  The concept is that the GPIO are the slave selects for the individual devices, but the SCL, SDI and SDO are shared between the two processors.  This is also scalable up to n devices, where your only limitation is the bus bandwidth on the SPI bus and the number of GPIO lines at your disposal.

Slave Select2 ---------------------------------------------| 			           |-----------------
		                                           |_______________________________|

       xxxxxxxxxx_| |_| |_| |_| |_| |_| |_| |_| |_xxxxxxxxxx_| |_| |_| |_| |_| |_| |_| |_| |_xxxxxxxxxx

The code alternates between sending data from one device to another and mixed.

2. Folder Contents:
-------------------
This folder contains the following sub-folders:
a. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        This folder will have the device GLD file, it is used for building the project. 
	This file was provided with the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

b. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        This folder contains C header files useful in building this
        project. Device register and bit definitions are provided in
        the *.h file that follows the device name. These files were provided
        with the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

c. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\lib
        This folder contains library archive files, which are a
        collection of precompiled object files. The file
        named "libpic30-coff.a" contains the C run-time start-up
        library. These file were provided with the
        MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

d. hex
        This folder contains three file types - coff, hex and map.
        These are files generated by the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite on build
        operation performed within MPLAB® IDE. The *.map file contains
        details on memory allocation for various variables, constants
        and dsPIC instructions specified in the source and library
        code. The *.hex file contains a binary file that may be
        programmed into the dsPIC device. The *.coff file contains
        a binary file that is used by MPLAB® IDE for simulation.

e. h
        This folder contains include files for the code example.


f. src
        This folder contains all the C and Assembler source files (*.c,
        *.s) used in demonstrating the described example. This folder
        also contains a sub-folder named "obj" that stores compiled
        object files generated when the project is built.


3. Suggested Development Resources:
-----------------------------------
        a. Explorer 16 Demo board with dsPIC33FJ256GP710 controller

4. Reconfiguring the project for a different dsPIC33F device:
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Project/Workspace can be easily reconfigured for any dsPIC33F device.
Please use the following general guidelines:
        a. Change device selection within MPLAB® IDE to a dsPIC33F device of
        your choice by using the following menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Configure>>Select Device

        b. Provide the correct device linker script and header file for your
        device. Device linker scripts and header files are available in your
        MPLAB® C30 installation folder under:
        Device Linker Script-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        Device C Header file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        Device ASM Include file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\inc

        c. Provide the appropriate path to your MPLAB C30 support file locations
        using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build Options>>Project

        d. Chose the development board applicable to your device. Some options
        are provided below:


        e. Re-build the MPLAB® project using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build All

        f. Download the hex file into the device and run.
